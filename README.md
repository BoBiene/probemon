# probemon-docker
A docker container hosting the python script from https://github.com/klein0r/probemon. 
Inspired by https://github.com/offlinehacker/docker-ap for accessing the wireless network from docker

## Test

```
docker run --rm -it --privileged --net host -e INTERFACE=wlan1 bobiene/probemon
```

## Usage

```
usage: docker run --privileged --net host -e INTERFACE=wlan1 bobiene/probemon [-h] [-i INTERFACE] [-t TIME] [-o OUTPUT] [-b MAX_BYTES]

## Locally Administered Addresses

> A locally administered address is assigned to a device by a network administrator, overriding the burned-in address.

> Universally administered and locally administered addresses are distinguished by setting the second-least-significant bit of the first octet of the address. This bit is also referred to as the U/L bit, short for Universal/Local, which identifies how the address is administered.
(source Wikipedia)

These type of MAC addresses are used by recent various OS/wifi stack to send probe requests anonymously, and using at the same time randomization.

So it defeats tracking and render probemon useless in that case. But not all devices are using this randomization technique, yet.

## Device behavior
It should be noted that not all devices are equal. They vary a lot in behavior regarding of the probe requests (PR). This should be taken into account when analyzing the data collected.

Depending on the type of device (PC/laptop/..., printer, mobile phone/tablet, IoT device), the OS used (Linux, Windows, Android, MacOS/iOS, unknown embedded OS, ...) the wifi chipset and/or the wifi/network stack, one device behave differently from one another when sending probe request.

Even phone using the same OS like android, can behave differently: some send PR every 30 seconds, while others only send PR when the screen is unlocked.

# Legality

I am not a lawyer and I can't give you any advice regarding the law.
But it might not be legal to collect and store probe requests in your country.

Even simply listening to probe requests might not be legal. For example, given the interpretation of *Section 18 U.S. Code ยง 2511*, it might not be legal to intercept the MAC addresses of devices in a network (?) or in the vicinity (?) in the U.S.A.

In Europe, if you are operating as a business, storing MAC addresses, which are considered private data, might be subject to the *GDPR*.

This is only straching the surface of the legality or illegality of this software.

Use with caution.
